# Privacy Policy

**QuickSummary** does not collect, store, or process any of your personal information. All of your data remains on your device.

The app's core summarization and chat features are powered by **Firebase AI (using Google's Gemini model)**. When you use these AI features, the content you provide (such as text to be summarized or chat messages) is sent to Google's servers to generate a response.

### Data Usage by Third-Party Services

Because this app utilizes a free tier of Firebase, please be aware of the following, as stated in their policy:

- Your content may be used to improve and develop Google's products, including their machine learning technologies.
- To help with quality and product improvement, human reviewers may read, annotate, and process your AI inputs and outputs.
- Google takes steps to protect your privacy during this process by disconnecting the data from your personal account information.

We strongly advise you **not to submit any sensitive, confidential, or personal information** through the AI features.

For complete details on how Google handles this data, please refer to the official [Gemini API Terms of Service](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms), which govern the use of these features within Firebase.
